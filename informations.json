Leaksintra, however, used his salesmanship to encourage the local people to contribute money as well, until the project was finished. The architect excavated a large pond on the right side of the temple called Leaksintrada. A golden Silva lingam was kept in the middle of the pond. Nearby, a village of wealthy people was formed. In addition, people from nearby villages were invited to live there, too, and the village soon became a crowded but cheerful town. Leaksintra told the king of the new town, and the king went there to celebrate the town's inauguration in AD 1025. He gave the city numerous gifts, including 29 soldiers and a rice field that surrounded the temple.",

The architect excavated a large pond on the right side of the temple called Leaksintrada. A golden Silva lingam was kept in the middle of the pond. Nearby, a village of wealthy people was formed. In addition, people from nearby villages were invited to live there, too, and the village soon became a crowded but cheerful town. Leaksintra told the king of the new town, and the king went there to celebrate the town's inauguration in AD 1025.
